title: Train Neural Networks with Neural Networks
---

I explore some simple approaches for automatic learing of the training algorithms for nerual netwoks (as well as for other predicitve models). I show why this is a hard problem for standard approaches (in particular for deep learning) and what new insights can be learned while solving it. I continue with more dedicated approaches in part 2 of this post.

**The main idea**

... is summarized in the figure below:



**Conclusion**
