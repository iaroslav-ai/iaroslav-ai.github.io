title: Training neural nets with neural nets: part 1
---

In this post I explore some simple approaches for learing the training algorithms for nerual netwoks (as well as for other predicitve models). I show why this is a hard problem for standard approaches (in particular for deep learning) and what new insights can be learned while solving it.

**Introduction**

**Formulation as regression problem**

**Simple feed forward model**

**RNN**

**Formulation as loss minitmization problem**

**Example where gradient descent fails**
